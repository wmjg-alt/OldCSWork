Our project starts with choosing either a migratory or non-migratory bird. If a migratory bird is chosen, a mini map will show the migratory path. Then, the player goes on to play a "temple run" like game where the bird on the screen  needs to avoid obstacles, which depend on the type of bird (migratory or non-migratory) by either jumping, ducking down, or moving side to side. If the bird hits an obstacle, then a quiz question pops up, which the player needs to answer correctly to continue playing. After a minute of playing time, the player will reach the bird's nest and complete a quiz based on the type of bird chosen at the end of the game.
